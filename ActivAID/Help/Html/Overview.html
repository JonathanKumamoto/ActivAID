ATE Test Platform, v5.x : An Overview</a></h1>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The ActivATE™ ATE Test Platform was designed from the ground up using Microsoft's® latest
technology.&nbsp; It is a standard Windows® &quot;look-and-feel&quot;
application written in C# for fast execution.&nbsp; Either VBScript, C#, or 
VB.Net may be used as the as the
test program engine (or all three simultaneously). It combines a graphical user interface with text-based code that
provides a very simple and easy-to-use yet extremely powerful environment,
allowing for rapid application development.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p>With pre-defined access levels, <font face="Verdana" size="2">ActivATE is well-suited for both the
test engineer and the test operator on the shop floor.&nbsp;A multi-threaded
test execution environment allows multiple TIU's (Test Interface Units or test heads) to run
independently and concurrently.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="bin/MainScreen.png" width="933" height="789"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The overall theory of 
<a href="TestPrograms.html">test program developmen</a>t
is quite simple.&nbsp; We add Groups and Tests to the tree in the
<a href="TestSequenceView.html">Test Sequence View</a>.&nbsp; Each Group and Test is called a node, 
and these nodes are capable of executing
VBScript, C#, or VB.Net test code that performs certain functions, such as reading a DMM value.&nbsp; Typically, the test code is used to make calls into the
device drivers (no need to use &quot;CreateObject&quot; in VBScript, we've done that for
you).&nbsp; Each driver or device has its own set of APIs (Application 
Programming Interface) that perform certain functions.&nbsp; For example, a
VBScript command to close a relay on a switch card would be: </font>
<font face="Courier New"><span class="auto-style1"><strong>nRetVal = Switch1.Close(nRelay)</strong></span></font><font size="2" face="Courier New">. </font><font face="Verdana">A</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">s the test engineer 
adds nodes to the test sequence, a VBScript test
shell (or .NET DLL for .NET code) is created behind the scenes for the user.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
No need to save or compile.&nbsp; Simply press the RUN (or Play) button to 
execute the program.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Login levels and permissions, data logging, trace
outputs, time stamping, error debugging, break points, loop on test, stop on
test, stop on fail, and many more features are built into the
environment.&nbsp; In addition, by using VBScript, the user also has full access
to many other creatable objects such as Microsoft Excel®, Word®, and Access®, thus
creating an open architecture that becomes very scalable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
.NET test code, the .NET System Namespace is fully exposed to the test program, making the ActivATE test 
environment a very robust and intuitive ATE platform.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">Language-specific color coding gives a clear and
concise text environment for developing test programs.&nbsp; Script errors are
reported in the trace output window where the user simply clicks on the error
message to get to the exact line of script where the error occurred.</font></p>
