<h1 class="auto-style2">Using the ActivATE SDK (Software Development Kit)</h1>
<p class="auto-style3">The ActivATE SDK is designed to create a driver shell 
that developers can add their own code to.&nbsp; The driver shell comes in two 
flavors:&nbsp; a Simple Add In or an Instrument Driver that references VISA.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="auto-style3">To install the SDK, download the latest SDK install 
from the ActivATE web site at:</span><br class="auto-style3" />
<span class="auto-style3">

http://www2.astronicstestsystems.com/ActivATE/SoftwareInfo/Features/SDKInfo.aspx</a></span></p>
<p class="auto-style3">Run the SDK MSI file and follow the directions.&nbsp; The 
templates will be installed for both Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010.&nbsp; 
After installing the ActivATE SDK, two project templates will be available in 
Visual Studio.&nbsp; Using the Visual Studio<strong> File&rarr;New Project</strong> 
menu item, select "ActivATE Test Platform" as the installed template type from 
the Visual C# selections.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two templates are available:&nbsp; An 
Instrument Driver template and the Simple Add-In template.</p>
<p>
<img alt="SDK" height="311" longdesc="Software Development Kit" src="bin/SDK1.PNG" width="846" /></p>
<p class="auto-style3">The <em>Simple Add-In</em> template is a framework that 
will inherit from the Interfaces base class "GenericDriver".&nbsp; The <em>
Instrument</em> template will inherit from the Interfaces base class "GenericInstrument".&nbsp; 
Both of these base classes will give a rich set of interfaces and tools to the 
new driver. Developers should only select the Instrument Template if they need 
to write an instrument driver that will communicate with hardware over VISA, 
RS-232, GPIB, TCP/IP, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="auto-style3">As an example, let's create a Simple Add-In module. 
Select this as the template and enter any name and location you wish for the new 
Add-In.</p>
<p class="auto-style3">
<img alt="" height="118" longdesc="Simple Addin" src="bin/SDK2.PNG" width="401" /></p>
<p class="auto-style3">The next dialog that appears will be for the name of the 
"back-end" driver class and the "front-end" GUI class.&nbsp; You may select any 
name you wish for either class name, however, it is recommended that "Dvr" be 
used as a suffix for the driver class and "Ctrl" be used as the suffix for the 
GUI class.&nbsp; When this module is added to the ActivATE framework using the 
Configuration Manager dialog box, these two class names will be selected 
automatically, triggered off the "Dvr" and "Ctrl" suffix.&nbsp; </p>

		<img alt="Add In Picture" height="282" longdesc="Add In Class Selection" src="bin/SDK_ADDIN.PNG" width="375" /></td>
		<td>After pressing the "Finish" button, the Visual Studio project will

		<img alt="SDK Project" height="126" longdesc="SDK Project" src="bin/SDKAddIn2.PNG" width="175" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p class="auto-style3">The project is already setup to use ActivATE as the debug 
EXE program.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this step, developers can build and run the project.&nbsp; 
The output of the new "MyAddIn.DLL" will go directly to the ActivATE runtime 
directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The driver is not automatically added to the ActivATE 
configuration.&nbsp; This will have to be done manually through the "<a href="AddingDrivers.htm">Configuration 
Manager</a>"</p>
<p class="auto-style3">When ActivATE launches and the driver is part of the 
ActivATE configuration (toolset), developers can now debug and step through 
code.&nbsp; Since ActivATE runs in the "front-end", and this is the application 
we have set Visual Studio to use as the debug EXE, only the new Add-In GUI class 
(in this case, "MyAddInCtrl" class) can be debugged as things stand 
out-of-the-box.&nbsp; To debug the back-end, that is, the "MyAddInDvr" class, 
the developer will have to "Attach to Process" using the Visual Studio Debug 
Tools menu and attach to the "StationRuntime" exe.&nbsp; Now developers can step 
into and out-of both the front-end GUI class and back-end driver class.</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><strong>DEVELOPERS NOTE FOR VISUAL STUDIO 2010 </strong>:&nbsp; 
If developers are debugging an add-in by running a .NET test program in ActivATE, 
Visual Studio 2010 will lock a temporary output file used by the .NET compiler 
(TIU1.DLL).&nbsp; That is, developers will get one chance to run a test program 
before Visual Studio locks the file.&nbsp; On subsequent test program runs, this 
file is rebuilt and needs to be overwritten; it cannot be (it is locked by 
Visual Studio).&nbsp; This does not occur in VS2008.&nbsp; If debugging API 
calls in the driver, VS2010 developers are encouraged to use VBScript to debug 
the API call or to simply use the GUI to call the API (as in pressing a "test" 
button.&nbsp; </p>
