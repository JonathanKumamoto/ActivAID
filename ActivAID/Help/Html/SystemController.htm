<h1>System Controller - Page 1</h1>
<p>The System Controller module contains the &quot;business logic&quot; for the 
ActivATE test 
environment.&nbsp; Generally, users will never need or use this module.&nbsp; 
However, some test applications may require more than just generic test execution.&nbsp; 
Perhaps a SECS/GEM interface needs to be created or there is a requirement to 
time schedule certain test programs.&nbsp; The System Control module (SystemController) 
is designed for this type of customization. </p>
<p><b>System Architecture:</b></p>
<p>The ActivATE Integrated Test Environment consists of two applications running 
simultaneously: ActivATE.EXE and StationRuntime.EXE.&nbsp; ActivATE.exe is considered the &quot;front-end&quot; GUI environment and 
the StationRuntime.exe is considered the &quot;back-end&quot; test execution and 
hardware interface environment. The 
ActivATE application manages the user input, sinks events from the back-end 
runtime devices, displays user information, and generally manages the overall test environment. The StationRuntime 
application is responsible for executing the test programs, creating instrument 
drivers and user defined add-in modules, and manages the test sequencer.</p>
<p>There are two ways to run a test program in ActivATE.&nbsp; One way is 
through the front-end IDE or Integrated Development Environment.&nbsp; Using the IDE is 
the most common way if all we want to do is run one or two test programs.&nbsp; 
Users can load, execute, debug, and edit test programs all from the IDE.&nbsp; 
Test operators can also run test programs from the IDE, but test code is 
hidden for an operator's level of access.&nbsp; If we load up three or four test 
programs in the IDE simultaneously, we see the IDE starting to get 
somewhat cluttered, so the other way to execute test programs is through the Test 
Program Manager (TPMngr) as a background process.</p>
<p>The TPMngr (Test Program Manager) is a module that lives in the front-end ActivATE.exe.&nbsp; 
The TPMngr 
creates and executes test programs as a background thread on the StationRuntime.&nbsp; GUI environments are inherently slow so the StationRuntime 
was built as a console application.&nbsp; It is very efficient and capable of 
running up to 36 test programs simultaneously and independently.&nbsp; When the 
test program executes, the TestSequencer broadcasts events to all subscribers, 
such as 'Passed', 'Failed', 'Running', 'LoadFailed', etc.&nbsp; If executing 
tests from 
the TPMngr, TestSequencer events are <i>asynchronous.&nbsp; </i>Asynchronous 
events are cached and processed by the TPMngr in the order they arrived.&nbsp; 
If running from the IDE, TestSequencer events are <i>synchronous</i>.&nbsp; This 
is so the Test Sequencer View is synchronous with the actual test program 
execution. </p>
<p>The SystemControl module creates the TPMngr object, starts the 
StationRuntime.exe, and connects all the drivers.&nbsp; If the driver inherits 
from IDevice, then OnConnection()&nbsp; is called by the SystemControl to 
perform any initialization of the driver. Developers wishing to customize this 
behavior, have full access to the source code.</p>
<p>The following is a high-level block diagram of the ActivATE

Take note of the SystemController. We will discuss this on the
