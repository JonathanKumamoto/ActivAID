<h1><a name="Top">Locals Watch Window</a></h1>
<p>The locals watch window is used to examine the values of variables in the 
test program.&nbsp; By default, the Locals Watch Window is not visible in the IDE.&nbsp; 
To toggle the visibility of the Locals Watch Window, click Locals (Debug) from 
the View menu.&nbsp; You may also click the Locals Watch Window icon
<img border="0" src="bin/localsWindow.png" width="18" height="18"> in the Debug 
toolbar to show the Locals Watch Window.&nbsp; When visible, it is docked in 
front of the Properties Page.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The variables to be watched in the Locals Watch Window are automatically 
selected.&nbsp; The user has no control over which variables are watched here.&nbsp; 
All locally defined variables will automatically be placed in the Locals Watch 
Window.&nbsp; As soon as they go out of scope, they are removed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When the test program is run in debug mode and breaks at a breakpoint, the 
variables in the Locals Watch Window will be shown with their current value and 
type, if available.&nbsp; If a variable has not yet been initialized, the value will 
be &quot;Empty&quot;.&nbsp; When stepping through the code, the values in the Locals Watch 
Window will be updated as they are changed.&nbsp; </p>
<table style="width: 100%">
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 359px">
		<img height="34" src="bin/DebugToolBar.png" width="340"></td>
		<td>Users can select the &quot;HEX&quot; mode if they wish to see integer values 
		displayed as Hex.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<p>The following test program is in a break state in the first iteration of the 
For loop in function t2.&nbsp; The Locals Watch Window reflects the current 
value of 'cntr2', which is a locally defined variable.&nbsp; The variable 'cntr2', 
which refers to the return value of the function, is a local variable but is 
undefined at this point.&nbsp; The global variable 'GlobalVal' does not appear 
in the Locals Watch Window even though it is in scope because it is not locally 
defined.</p>
