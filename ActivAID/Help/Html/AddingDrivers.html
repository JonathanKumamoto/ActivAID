<h1><a name="Top">Adding a New Driver</a></h1>
<p>These steps describe how to add a new driver to the ActivATE<font face="Verdana">™ 
environment.</font></p>
<ol>
	<li>To get started, use one of the following methods:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li type="a">Right-click anywhere in the tree view in the Configuration 
		pane and select &quot;Add New&quot; from the context menu.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="bin/AddDriver1.png" width="268" height="181"><br>
&nbsp;</li>
		<li type="a">Drag and drop the .DLL or .EXE assembly file that contains 
		the driver you would like to add to the tree view in the Configuration 
		pane.&nbsp; If the assembly is recognized as an ActivATE<font face="Verdana">™-specific 
		assembly, the ActivATE™ environment will try to automatically add the 
		driver for you.&nbsp; Simply provide a test program reference name and a 
		description in the fields as shown below, then click OK:<br>
		<br>
		<img border="0" src="bin/AddDriver3.png" width="344" height="268"><br>
		<br>
		If the assembly is not recognized, the configuration tool will appear 
		instead.&nbsp; Follow the instructions below to continue adding the 
		driver.</font></li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
	<li type="1" value="2">The configuration tool appears.&nbsp; Click the file 
	browse button next to the File Name text box to open a file browser dialog 
	and select the driver assembly to add.&nbsp; The driver assembly should be a 
	.NET or COM DLL or EXE file.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li type="1">After the driver assembly has been selected, the classes that 
	are available within the assembly will be displayed in the Assembly Classes 
	tree view.&nbsp; Expand a class to view the public methods and properties 
	that are exposed in that class.<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li type="1">The tool will attempt to 
	recommend the driver and UI (User Interface) classes to use.&nbsp; The 
	driver class will be used to create an object for the test program to 
	access, and its public API's will be available to the test program.&nbsp; 
	The UI class is optional, but can only be specified for an ActivATE<font face="Verdana">™-specific 
	assembly</font>.&nbsp; If provided, the UI class determines the form that 
	will be created when the user clicks the icon for the driver on the 
	Outlook-style toolbar.&nbsp; A UI provides a quick and easy way of accessing 
	the driver's functionality without having to run a test program.&nbsp; <br>
	<br>
	If the assembly is a recognized ActivATE<font face="Verdana">™-specific assembly, the tool should 
	successfully locate the correct classes.&nbsp; These will be highlighted in 
	yellow in the Assembly Classes tree view and they will be automatically 
	filled in in the Driver Class Name and UI Class Name text boxes, as shown 
	below:<br><br>&nbsp;</font><table border="0" width="72%" id="table1">
		<tr>
			<td width="591">
			<img border="0" src="bin/ConfigTool1.png" width="581" height="339"></td>
			<td>The GPIBDriver.dll assembly is an ActivATE<font face="Verdana">™-specific 
			assembly and the tool was therefore able to recommend the correct 
			classes we should use for this driver.</font></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><br>If the tool was not able to recommend any classes, or if you would like to 
	change the selected classes, right-click on the class you would like to use 
	in the tree view and select either &quot;Use as Driver class&quot; or &quot;Use as UI 
	class&quot; from the context menu.</font></p>
	<p><img border="0" src="bin/ConfigTool2.png" width="349" height="220"><br>
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>Enter the name to be used to reference this driver from the test program 
	in the TP Reference text box.&nbsp; This name must be unique among all other 
	test program reference names within the same configuration.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the ToolBar Group text box, enter the group name that this driver 
	will appear under in the Outlook-style toolbar.&nbsp; This field only 
	applies if a UI class has been selected.&nbsp; The default group is 
	&quot;Devices&quot;.&nbsp; Additional groups will be added after the Devices pane in 
	the Outlook-style toolbar.&nbsp; The following example shows the result of 
	adding a device in a group called &quot;Switch Cards&quot;:<br>
	<br>
	<img border="0" src="bin/AddDriver2.png" width="184" height="209"><br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Enter a brief description of the driver in the Description text box.&nbsp; 
	This field is optional.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Finally, click the Add Driver button to add the new driver to the 
	current configuration, or click Cancel to exit without adding the driver.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>Important: </b>&nbsp;<b>Committing Changes</b></i></p>
<p align="left">After the new driver has successfully been added, the 
Reinitialize button on the toolbar will be highlighted in yellow as shown below.&nbsp; 
The new driver will NOT be available until the environment has been 
reinitialized or until the application is restarted.&nbsp; To reinitialize, make 
sure all test programs and driver UI's are closed and then click the 
Reinitialize button.<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="bin/reinitializeButton.png" width="297" height="187"></p>
<p align="left">If at any time you wish to cancel your changes, click the 
Rollback button at the bottom of the properties page.&nbsp; This will undo all 
changes that have been made since the last reinitialization.&nbsp; The Rollback 
button is only enabled if there are uncommitted changes (until the system is 
reinitialized or until the application is shut down).</p>
