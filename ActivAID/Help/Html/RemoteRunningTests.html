<h1>Running Tests With Remoting</h1>
<p>When using remoting, a server and its multiple clients are able to access the 
    same group of slots to run their test programs.&nbsp; They are all also able to 
    control the same shared devices.&nbsp; All the clients and the server must have 
    access to the network drive that contains the desired test program in order to 
    run together.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>A server can run tests on any slot in TP manager or the IDE without reserving it, 
        as long as the slot isn't reserved by a client.</p>
    <p>In the example below, the TP manager shows that slots 2, 9, and 13 are 
        reserved by a client with IP address '172.16.2.86', and that the server cannot load tests on 
        these slots.&nbsp; However, the server can use any of the other available slots 
        for testing.</p>

    <p>A client can only run tests on slots that they have reserved.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
        the following error message is seen.</p>

    <p>
        In the example below, the TP manager shows that slots 3, 5, and 7 are reserved 
        by the server with IP address '172.16.2.78', and that the server cannot load 
        tests on these slots.&nbsp; The test program only runs on slots that are 
        reserved by this client.</p>
