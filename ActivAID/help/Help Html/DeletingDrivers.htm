<h1><a name="Top">Deleting a Driver</a></h1>
<p>To delete a driver from the current configuration, right-click on the driver 
to be deleted in the tree view on the Configuration pane and select &quot;Delete&quot; 
from the context menu.&nbsp; </p>

<p>If a driver under the Devices category is deleted and this driver had an 
associated UI object under the Controls category, both the device and the 
control will be deleted.&nbsp; If a driver under the Controls category is 
deleted, only the UI itself will be removed.&nbsp; The device driver will still 
be present under the Devices category.&nbsp; </p>
<p><i><b>Important: </b>&nbsp;<b>Committing Changes</b></i></p>
<p align="left">After a driver has been deleted, the Reinitialize button on the 
toolbar will be highlighted in yellow as shown below.&nbsp; The deleted driver 
will still be available until the environment has been reinitialized or until 
the application is restarted.&nbsp; To reinitialize, make sure all test programs 
and driver UI's are closed and then click the Reinitialize button.<br>

<p align="left">If at any time you wish to cancel your changes, click the 
Rollback button at the bottom of the properties page.&nbsp; This will undo all 
changes that have been made since the last reinitialization.&nbsp; The Rollback 
button is only enabled if there are uncommitted changes (until the system is 
reinitialized or until the application is shut down).</p>
