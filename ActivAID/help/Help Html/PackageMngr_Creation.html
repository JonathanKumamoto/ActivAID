<h1>Package Creation</h1>
<p>For package creation, the following context menu commands (applied on the 
root of ActivATE Project Manager root) are relevant:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Build:</strong> Test Procedure Binary file is created. Its full 
	path name and location is displayed in ActivATE Script Trace Log toolbar. 
	(If ActivATE Script Trace Log toolbar is not visible, it must be enabled 
	from View pull-down menu.)</li>
	<li><strong>Package for Deployment:</strong> Project.package is created at 
	the place where the project sequence file is.</li>
	<li><strong>Extract from Package:</strong> This command expands a 
	Project.package built with a previous <strong>Package for Deployment</strong> 
	command.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Package for Deployment command</strong></p>
<p>ActivATE shows in its Script Trace Log toolbar the files included in the 
package, along with their MD5 Hash Codes and file sizes. (If ActivATE Script 
Trace Log toolbar is not visible, it must be enabled from View pull-down menu.)</p>
<p>The MD5 codes are saved in _md5_hash_values_in_package.xml, which is a file 
added to the package behind the scene. Its role is to provide the MD5 Hash Codes 
for each project file at unpacking time in order to validate the correctness of 
that operation.</p>

<p><strong>Extract from Package command</strong></p>
<p>This command expands a previously created Package file. When operation 
completed, the user may choose to inspect the extracted folder:</p>

<p>MD5 Hash Code verification errors are always reported in ActivATE Event 
Logger form, like below:</p>
