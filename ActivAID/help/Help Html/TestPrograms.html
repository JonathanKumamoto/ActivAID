<h1>Test Program Overview</h1>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All ActivATE test programs are comprised of a
sequence file (.seq extension) and at least one test script file (.tpf
extension).&nbsp; The sequence file format is an Extensible Markup Language,
or XML file and displayed graphically as a TreeView (much like a directory 
structure).&nbsp; It contains information about the test program such as the test and
group nodes, test properties, execution sequence and other user configurable
settings.&nbsp; This file is generated automatically by ActivATE, and in
general, it should not be edited by the user.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The test script file contains the main VBScript, 
C#, or VB.Net code for the test program.&nbsp; The outline for this test script 
is created automatically when a new test program is created and as new test and 
group nodes are added.&nbsp; The user completes this file by adding the test code needed
to implement each test.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Optionally, for VBScript files, a globals file may be included (.gtf
extension).&nbsp; The globals file is also a VBScript file and is used to
implement methods, properties and classes that may be used by multiple test
programs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These three files are named after the test
program.&nbsp; For example, a new test program created with the name &quot;MyTest&quot;
would automatically create the files MyTest.seq, MyTest.tpf, and, if VBScsript 
and a globals
file is to be used, MyTest.gtf.</font></p>
<h1>Organizing a Test Program</h1>
<p class="auto-style1">Test Engineers should put some thought into designing a 
test program (sometimes called a test flow) and how the logical groups are 
organized.&nbsp; For example, there should be a &quot;Setup&quot; or initialization group, 
a main test group, and a &quot;Cleanup&quot; or shutdown group.&nbsp; This allows the test 
engineer to partition and validate the test program more logically.&nbsp; 
Sections can easily be <a href="TestNodeProps.html#Enable">disabled</a> (right-mouse-click on the node) or run 
separately.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style1">Think about logical grouping</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style1">Don't try to do too much in one test. Each test node 
	should be no longer than a page or page and half when viewed from the 
	editor.&nbsp; Break the test into relatively small, manageable parts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style1">Groups, as well as individual tests can be moved 
	around (drag and drop) after the test flow is created.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style1">As a general rule, the &quot;Shutdown&quot; group is used as a 
	branch node incase there are catastrophic errors (see test sequence below.&nbsp; 
	The blue flag on the test node shows this node has the
	<a href="TestNodeProps.html#BranchNode">branch-on-fail</a> flag set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style1">Keep the test names descriptive or add a description 
	(shown as a blue comment).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style1">As many sub-groups as needed may be used to add 
	clarity and control to the test sequence.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
