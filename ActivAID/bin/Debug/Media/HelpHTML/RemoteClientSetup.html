<h1><a name="Top"></a>Remote Client Setup Menu</h1>
<p>Accessing the Remote Client Setup menu provides users with a new remoting feature 
    that allows for two systems to communicate with each other to use the same 
    groups of slots and devices for testing.&nbsp; A group of systems exist together 
    in a client-server relationship.&nbsp; For each group, there is one server that 
    each client connects to.&nbsp; It is the only system that has the ability to 
    assign and release slots to each client.&nbsp; By default, a user's computer 
    acts as a server.&nbsp; To access the remoting feature settings, a user must 
    have admin priveleges and must access the remote client setup menu at the top 
    main toolbar of ActivATE.&nbsp; From this menu, a user can change their role 
    between client and server.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
