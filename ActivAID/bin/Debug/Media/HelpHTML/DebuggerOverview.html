<h1><a name="Top">Debugger Overview</a></h1>
<p>The script debugger is an extremely useful tool for developing test programs.&nbsp; 
It helps the user verify test program logic and determine the source of errors.&nbsp; 
To use the debugger effectively, it is important to understand how to utilize 
breakpoints and the watch windows to your advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>A breakpoint is a marker in the test program that signals the debugger to 
stop when execution reaches that point.&nbsp; A breakpoint may be set on a group 
node, a test node, a line in the Script View, or a line in the Globals View.&nbsp; 
When the debugger reaches a breakpoint and pauses, it is in a &quot;break&quot; state.&nbsp; 
A breakpoint on a group node causes the program to break at the first line of 
executable code in the group's PreTest function, and a breakpoint on a test node 
causes the program to break at the first line of executable code in the test's 
function.&nbsp; When the program stops at a breakpoint, the next line of code 
that will be executed is highlighted in yellow.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The watch windows are used to &quot;watch&quot; the values of the test program's 
variables.&nbsp; The Locals Watch Window watches only those variables that are 
local to the current function, and the Watch Window watches any variables the 
user requests it to.&nbsp; Use the watch windows to verify that variables 
contain expected values.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Once the test program reaches a breakpoint, you may examine variables in the 
watch windows, investigate the current state of the system by using the driver 
UI's, or step through the code line by line.&nbsp; You may also add additional 
breakpoints or remove existing breakpoints before continuing the program.</p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Tip: </b>&nbsp;Once the test program starts execution 
in debug mode, it will stay in debug mode until either the program completes or 
is stopped by the user.&nbsp; Therefore, clicking run

program after stopping at a breakpoint will not prevent the program from 
breaking at subsequent breakpoints.</font></p>
<p><b>General steps for using the debugger:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Set breakpoints in the code and/or the Test Sequence View.</li>
  <li>Run the debugger.</li>
  <li>After a breakpoint is reached, step through the code while examining 
  variables in the watch windows.</li>
  <li>Click run to continue running in debug mode until either the next 
  breakpoint or the end of the program, or click stop to end debug mode.</li>
  <li>If necessary, make changes to your code and re-run in debug mode.</li>
</ol>
